# Sentience
A framework to automatically search for the best models using AutoML philosophies. Just define a dataset and other optional hyperparameters and wait for the framework to search the best model that can surpass some human defined models as well. The workflow definition is done using a `.stnt` file which the compiler `sentienc` parses and creates a workspace. We can define minimal hyperparameters like `dataset` and `epochs` per model to get the system started, or we can opt for more granular controls.
